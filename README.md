This is a little robot thing for Second Life, it flies around and does stuff.

Project for Interactive Systems, by Ross Brunton, 2012, etc.

As of yet, there is no way for anyone to get this robot, besides copying it, or something, so uh, maybe I'll do that later. Who knows?

Anyway, todo list can be seen here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pp2HNk0z8lmbBMBLaXnaLuJ2C_eF2jpt4FfZpRgI1gA/edit, which I should really learn how to format into a link, or so. Whatever. MAYBE IT'LL HAPPEN AUTOMATICALLY AND THAT SENTENCE MAKES ME LOOK STUPID!?
